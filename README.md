This project is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) and based in [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository.

Write code that works is easy. But writing efficient, clear, concise and maintainable code is very difficult.

Thinking about it, I decided to explore even more this amazing programming language to abandon addictions of other languages and to have more and more pythonic abilities.
