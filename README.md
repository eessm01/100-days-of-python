This project is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) and based in [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository.

Write code that works is easy (the most of times). But writing efficient, clear, concise and maintainable code is very difficult.

Python is a great language which you code more with less. There are a lot of facilities that helps you gain more time to focus on other development details. I decided to explore even more this amazing programming language to be able to take advantage of everything it has to offer, being more pythonic without the addictions of other languages.

In this repository I learn something new about Python every day during 100 days.
