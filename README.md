This project is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) post and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go)

Here, I will learn something about the Python programming language every day, with baby steps, to improve my skills.
