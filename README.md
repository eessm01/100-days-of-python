## What is this?

**100 Days Of Python** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about Python every day during 100 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
- [100 Days Of Ruby](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-ruby)
- [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin)
- [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift)

## Why am I doing this? Why Python?

Writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing efficient, clear, concise, scalable, and maintainable code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding.

**Python** is a great language which you code *more* with *less*. There are a lot of facilities that helps you gain more time to focus on other development details. I decided to explore even more this amazing programming language to be able to take advantage of everything it has to offer, being more pythonic without the addictions of other languages.

## Usage

These examples were compiled with **Python 3.6** and there are some dependencies. So, to the correct operation of these examples, you need to use Python 3.6 and install all repository dependencies. To install the dependencies, you can use *pip* as following:

```
pip install -r requirements.pip
```

> **NOTE**: It is recommended to create a virtual environment to keep your system clear. See more details in https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/.
